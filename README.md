# [ASTRO-CUBE](https://astro-cube.vercel.app) ðŸ§Š

a tiny, almost-unopinionated [Astro](https://astro.build/) starter for your next blog, documentation, personal/marketing website, and more.

it comes with the [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) file structure, a methodology for managing stylesheets efficiently no matter the size of the project.

the project is mostly barebones, the goal isn't to provide a batteries-included template, just an easy starter kit and stylesheets to copy/paste from.

most styles are for demo purposes and to explain the underlying philosophy: "Be the browser's mentor, not its micromanager" (see [buildexcellentwebsit.es](buildexcellentwebsit.es)).

## features

- **[CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) implementation**: take a look at the docs, they are concise and explain way better than i would
- **fluid and responsive**: it looks great no matter the device size
  - [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) examples for layout elements
  - [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) for fluid `clamp()`-based font sizes and spacing
- **lightweight**: ðŸ’¯ [lighthouse score](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/) across the board â€” not surprising considering the size of the project, but worth mentioning
- **dark-mode ready**: implement your own theme switcher if you're into that sort of thing, all you have to do is toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the body

## to do

- [ ] add design tokens as JSON rather than CSS variables
- [ ] generate utilities and CSS variables programmatically (see [this post](https://piccalil.li/blog/i-used-tailwind-for-the-u-in-cube-css-and-i-liked-it/))

> **Note**
>
> please note that this project is mostly for personal use, i've been using this approach a lot lately and having the minimal set-up ready saves me a ton of time when starting a new preoject.
>
> in that sense, this template is not set in stone and will likely evolve in the coming weeks.
>
> that said, it's great if it can be helpful to other, i'm open to feedback and greatly appreciate contributions, feel free to chip in for fixes, suggestions, or features!
